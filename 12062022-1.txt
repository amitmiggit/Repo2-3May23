As we got request for IPU for lpproflexdb01 which is cluster node and IPU has been done successfully, 
but cluster version also updated to 7.4.2 which is mismatching with partner node due to cluster not coming up. we involved matrix team they suggested two solution.

two solutions:
-- lpproflexdb01 should be rolled back to sles12sp4 -> packages must not be stopped, fallback
-- lpproflexdb02 should be updated to sles12sp5 -> in this case all of the packages must be stopped for hours
and as I know the upgrade from sles12sp4 to sp5 has difficulties

Note: Oracle  team not provided the downtime
