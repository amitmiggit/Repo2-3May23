We found that kernel is tainted due to AV process  we also got hanging call trace on this server , as a workaround AV is  disabled . we had similar kind of issue on li19dkocruat01vm which is now running since 12 days after disabling AV  , earlier  li19dkocruat01vm  server was getting into  freeze state immediately after restart now in stable state .  similar workaround is set on li19dkocruat02vm. Kindly let us how we can fix AV issue as AV is tainting Kernel .
